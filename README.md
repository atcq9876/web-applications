# ruby-web-applications

This repo was made for the Ruby web applications module of the Makers bootcamp (week four). The objectives of this module were to:

- Explain how HTTP requests and responses work at a high level
- Write integration tests for a web application
- Implement web routes using a lightweight web framework
- Follow a debugging process for a web application
- Deploy a web application using a light cloud service such as Heroku

These objectives were achieved by working through a sequence of exercises and challenges over one week, a full list of which can be found in the original Makers module [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/web-applications). My completed challenge for this week (a Twitter clone called Chitter, built using Ruby and Sinatra) can be found [here](https://github.com/atcq9876/chitter-challenge).
