# ruby-web-applications

This repo contains my solutions for the Ruby Web Applications module of the Makers bootcamp (week four). The objectives I achieved during this module include:

- Explain how HTTP requests and responses work at a high level
- Write integration tests for a web application
- Implement web routes using a lightweight web framework
- Follow a debugging process for a web application

My completed end-of-week challenge for this module (a Twitter clone called Chitter, built using Ruby and Sinatra) can be found [here](https://github.com/atcq9876/chitter-challenge).
